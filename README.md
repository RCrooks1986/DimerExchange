# DimerExchange
A simple R tool for producing dimer exchange plots from Chirascan protein CD scans

Use this dimer exchange calculator to create plots of circular dichroism dimer exchange assays.

To use, following these instructions:
1. Place the CSV files (you do not need to amend the files at all) created by the Chirascan for the 2 solutions prior to mixing, and the mixed solutions into the working directory (which you can set in R Studio).
2. Specify the names of the files where specified in the code.
3. Run the entire script. The graph is created with the filename dimerexchangeplot.png
